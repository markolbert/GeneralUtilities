# J4JSoftware.MiscellaneousUtilities

The library repository is available on [github](https://github.com/markolbert/ProgrammingUtilities/blob/master/MiscellaneousUtilities/docs/readme.md).

The change log is [available here](docs/changes.md).

This assembly contains a few miscellaneous utility methods I've found useful:

- Extension method for extracting PropertyInfo from an Expression `GetPropertyInfo<TContainer, TProp>()`
- Static method for validating configuration and output files `FileExtensions.ValidateFilePath()`
- Static hashing methods for strings, e.g., `CalculateHash()`
